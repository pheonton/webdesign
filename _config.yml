# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your entire site, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely need to edit after that.
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# `jekyll serve`. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Review documentation to determine if you should use `theme` or `remote_theme`
